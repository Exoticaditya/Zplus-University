### If Netlify deployment fails:
1. Ensure all files are present
2. Check for missing dependencies
3. Try drag & drop method first

### If mobile menu doesn't work:
1. Make sure `expressive-enhancements.js` is loaded
2. Check browser console for errors (F12)
3. Test on actual mobile device (not just resize)
